        <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven at 375°F (190°C). Grease the kuih bahulu mold with some oil. 
                        Preheat the mold in the oven. Remove from the oven, keep warm before using.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beat the eggs with an electric hand-mixer until light and fluffy. 
                        Add the sugar and continue to beat until the sugar is well dissolved and 
                        the mixture becomes sticky.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add in the vanilla extract and fold in the flour gradually. Add the cooking 
                        oil or butter. Continue to beat the batter with the hand-mixer until well-blended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill the mold with the batter, about 90% full. Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove the cake from the mold and cool on wire rack. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.
                    </li>
